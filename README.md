# Homework14

Task 1
Create a Circle class. This class will encapsulate the concept of a circle primarily through its
radius attribute. The radius should be a private attribute to ensure encapsulation.
Overload the following operators:
● Check if the radius of two circles are equal (==)
● Compare the areas of two circles (>, <, <=, >=)
These comparisons should be based on the circle's areas.
Use the formula Area = π * radius^2 where the π = 3.14.
These operators should return True or False depending on the result of the
comparison.
● Proportionally change the circle size by changing its radius (+, -, +=, -=)
○ The addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators should enable adding or
subtracting a numerical value to/from the circle’s radius, respectively, resulting
in a new Circle instance with the adjusted radius.
○ The addition assignment (+=) and subtraction assignment (-=) operators
should similarly adjust the circle's radius in place, modifying the existing Circle
instance.


Task 2
Create an Airplane class. Implement the following using the operator overloading:
● Check if the airplane types are equal (==)
● Increasing and decreasing the number of passengers in the cabin (the operators: + -
+= -=)
● Compare two airplanes for the maximum possible number of passengers on board
(the operators: > < <= >=).
